WP RSS By Publishers is built the way an aggregator should be.


== Description ==

WP RSS By Publishers is built the way an aggregator should be.

1. You create Publishers
2. You add feeds to each Publisher
3. You create a rule to assign feed posts to you categories based on:
- Specific feed (or all of them
- Specific tags/ categories that come with the feed or any (tag/category independent)

Create a system cron using the following script to pull new content from feed: wsys-feed-cron.php. This way you can add a lot of feeds without impacting on performance. Also you have control on the pulling intervals.

Features
*	Configure the minimum size for the imported pictures
*	Add the option of redirecting the user to original post
*	If you activate redirection to original post, you can also configure the utm_source in case you wish the publisher to know you as a referral
*	Works with RSS 2.0, Atom, etc.
*	Straightforward.
